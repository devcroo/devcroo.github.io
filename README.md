=================

Static Landing Page Site.
-----------------

If you are joining Devcroo and would like to edit/fiddle-around with the landing page, I suggest you take these steps:

 - On the top of this page: https://github.com/devcroo/devcroo.github.io, you will find three options (Watch, Star, Fork). Click on "Fork". This will create your own repo of the landing page.

 - Get the forked repo onto your local system by using: 
  > git clone https://github.com/[YOUR_USERNAME]/devcroo.github.io 
  
  (select any folder you'd like to store the repo in)

With these 2 steps, you should now have a local clone of the landing page.

Currently, these are the 2 main (or most important) documents for the landing page:

 - index.html
 - stylish-portfolio.css (found in "css" folder)

By modifying these 2 documents, you will be able to add any changes you'd like to see for the static landing page.

In order to get these changes shown on the site itself, you need to first do a "git push" to your forked GitHub repo. Once that is done, you now need to send a "Pull Request".

### Creating a Pull Request:

 - Go to: https://github.com/[YOUR_USERNAME]/devcroo.github.io
 - Once you are here, you will see a GREEN button just above the files/folders. If you scroll over it, you will see this text: "Compare, review, create a pull request"
 - By clicking on that green button, you will be able to create a Pull Request that I can merge into the original repo (and will cause any changes you made to show up)

I will add more details about how to keep your forked version of the repo up to date with the master version (depending on how many people decide to make improvements to the landing page).
